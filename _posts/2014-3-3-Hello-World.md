I am doctoral candiate in the [School of Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/people/david-betancourt) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu). My Ph.D. research is at the intersection of machine learning, uncertainty modeling, and numerical methods. In particular, I am developing machine learning algorithms that can be used in domains under significant uncertaintyâ€”with randomness, imprecise data, hidden information, and partial observability. Ultimately, the main goal of my research is to develop methods and algorithms for autonomous decision-making and control, where artificial agents have to act in real-world situations. The applications of my research include: physical infrastructure systems, markets & finance, cloud computing, and cyber-security.

My research has been applied in engineering (machine learning for material prediction and anomaly detection), finance (deep reinforcement learning for market trading), cloud computing (anomaly detection), and cyber-security (botnet detection).
