### David Betancourt, Ph.D.

David Betancourt is a computer scientist, engineer, fund manager, and tech entrepreneur. He specializes in artificial intelligence, high-performance computing for complex systems, and systematic trading. As **Founder and Fund Manager of DB Macro**, he directs the implementation of AI‐driven **investment strategies**. He also serves as Founder and CEO of Human Reinforce Labs, a tech startup building a new FinTech platform driven by agentic AI.

Dr. Betancourt has held pivotal roles across both industry and academia. At **Apple’s** Ad Platforms, he orchestrated the development of on-device, privacy-preserving AI/ML algorithms, architecting scalable, privacy-first machine learning for large-scale adtech and recommendation systems. Previously, as **Chief Scientist at Vorstella**, he drove innovations in AI-driven cloud infrastructure optimization until the company’s acquisition.

Dr. Betancourt earned his **Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech,** where his research focused on **uncertainty quantification in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and AI reliability**. He also holds two Master’s degrees—one in Computer Science and another in Engineering—as well as a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering with High Honors, all from Georgia Tech. Earlier in his career, he worked on **physics-informed machine learning for defense applications, reinforcement learning for cybersecurity in complex systems, and probabilistic risk modeling for nuclear reactors.**

Under his leadership, DB Macro has evolved over the past decade from an entrepreneurial initiative into a quant fund that has built its proprietary trading platform entirely in-house, anchored by a next-generation algorithmic engine. This platform integrates agentic AI, high-performance computing, advanced machine learning, and high-dimensional optimization algorithms—engineered to generate sustainable alpha in all market conditions. The operational insights gained from DB Macro laid the foundation for Human Reinforce Labs, where he now spearheads the creation of a FinTech platform that employs frontier agentic AI to unlock personalized financial decision-making at scale, ensuring users have access to reliable, advanced financial tools. His work reflects his philosophy of employing **safe AI to augment human decision-making in complex, high-stakes environments.**

For his doctoral studies, he worked under the guidance of Dr. Rafi L. Muhanna, in the Center for Reliable Engineering Computing lab. During his research, he pioneered the area of “interval deep learning,” which uses interval analysis for deep learning to solve problems under uncertainty. During his doctoral studies, he interned for the defense company STR, developing reinforcement learning algorithms for cyber-physical applications. In his free time in the course of his Ph.D., he developed market trading algorithms using deep reinforcement learning. Prior to joining Apple, he was the chief scientist of the AI technology start-up, Vorstella, which was acquired in 2020.
